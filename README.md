# TO-DO-LIST
Creating a To-Do List using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is, for me, an excellent way to improve my web development skills. With this project, I can learn to manipulate the DOM in JavaScript to add, delete, or mark tasks as completed. I structure my content with HTML, style it with CSS, and handle user interactions like clicks or inputs.
